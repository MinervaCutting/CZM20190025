Fuguring out that the game starts at 18:00, we will meet in the lobby at 16:00 to go to the stadium by bus. The stadium is located at Paseo de la Castellana, 15 minutes by bus from the hotel, but we have to take in a count that it turns into a really busy street when a football match and it can take long to reach the stadium. 

*The Club can't guarantee that all 40 people will be sitted together*

Once we arrive, our english speaking assistance will guide guests to the stadium and their door entrance.

* **Location** Paseo de la Castellana.

### DAY 3 - May 18th, 2020

Madrid had always a large tradition with beer, so thats why there are many craft breweries. 
On this morning we will visit a local and craft brewerie, *Mad Brewing*. We will have a bus at dispoal for the activity and after for a transfer to the airport. Guests will load the lugagge in the bus as we will go directly from the brewery to the airport. 

This is a traditional brewery located in the San Blas neighbourhood, which is a little off the beaten track from the city centre but is well worth a visit to try one of its beers, savour a delicious meal or tour its facilities.

Mad Brewing encompasses three different concepts in one space: it is a brewery, bar and a restaurant all in one. The establishment, decorated in a modern New York style, uses long tables and a perfect culinary proposal to wash down with a beer. 
Guests will enjoy of a visit into the brewery with a beer tasting. Finally, they will have the lunch there as there is a restaurant inside. 

* **Location** San Blas district. 
* **Duration** 4 hours aprox.  
* **Included** Bus at disposal, visit the brewery, beer tasting and lunch.
